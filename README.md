# Gatsby Theme Jam: Westegg-Gatsby-Theme-Misk Submission


## Getting Started
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn workspace demo develop
```

## Demo

Deployed with Netlify at [misk.westegg.xyz](https://misk.westegg.xyz/)

## Motivation
I wanted to build a docs site for [Misk-Web](https://github.com/cashapp/misk-web) using Gatsby Themes. 

Building a theme with Gatsby worked well and [it's now live](https://cashapp.github.io/misk-web/)!

This theme and demo also lives in [Westegg](https://github.com/westegg/westegg), a monorepo and directory for Gatsby Themes that I'm hoping to collaborate with others on moving forward.
