[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/adrw/gatsby-theme-jam-example.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/adrw/gatsby-theme-jam-example)

A submission to [Gatsby Theme Jam](https://themejam.gatsbyjs.org/). Lives in [Westegg](https://github.com/westegg/westegg).

## Getting Started
```
$ yarn install
$ yarn workspace demo develop
```

## Demo

Deployed with Netlify at [misk.westegg.xyz](https://misk.westegg.xyz/)

## Examples

- Misk-Web Docs Site at [cashapp.github.io/misk-web](https://cashapp.github.io/misk-web/)

## Motivation

I wanted to build a docs site for [Misk-Web](https://github.com/cashapp/misk-web) using Gatsby Themes.

Building a theme with Gatsby worked well and [the new Misk-Web docs site is now live](https://cashapp.github.io/misk-web/)!

## Westegg

This theme and demo also lives in [Westegg](https://github.com/westegg/westegg), a collaborative monorepo and directory for Gatsby Themes.
